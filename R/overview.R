### To do:
# Check R code on P9-10
# Check results text: primary outcomes
# Check results text: primary outcomes subgroups
# Check results text: primary outcomes sensitivity analysis
# Check results text: secondary outcomes
# Check results figures: primary outcomes
# Check results figures: primary outcomes subgroups
# Check results figures: primary outcomes sensitivity analysis
# Check primary outcome data in this paper vs original papers
# Check data in diagrams: primary
# Check data in diagrams: secondary
# Check funnel plots

### Completed:
# Check results figures: secondary outcomes

#### List of analyses: ####
#
#
# DONE:::
#
# Primary analysis of primary outcomes:
#   pneumonia
#   atelectasis
#
# Sensitivity analysis (1): "Leave one out" (pneumonia, atelectasis)
# Sensitivity analysis (2): Use Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkmann modification (pneumonia, atelectasis)
# Sensitivity analysis (3): Odds ratios (pneumonia, atelectasis)
#
#
# NOT DONE:
#
# Subgroup analyses:
#   Tidal volume (>6 vs <=6mL/kg)
#   PEEP (<0 vs 0)
#   Anesthesia type (TIVA vs inhaled)
#
# Issues with subgroup analyses:
#   Multiple/range of values given for tidal volume
#   No PEEP values greater than zero (dichotomisation is at zero)
#   Li et al. results are split in two in the primary outcome, but not clear if tidal volume etc. are the same in both sets of results.
#
# Secondary analysis:
#   respiratory compliance (OLV)
#   plateau pressure (OLV)
#   plateau pressure (TLV)
#   peak pressure (OLV)
#   peak pressure (TLV)
#   arterial oxygen pressure (OLV)
#   arterial oxygen pressure (TLV)
